    <h2>CodeRush (Beta release)</h2>
    <p>
      An essential tool for the programmer is the keyboard. It turns out that the most commonly used key is a backspace. Very ofter, mistakes are coused by miss-click or a bad typing technique. That reduces o ur efficiency and causes us to loose focus on the actual programming problem.
    </p>
    <p>
      CodeRush allows you to test your writing skills in 30 most popular technologies and 3 diffrent game modes. In addition to calculating the speed of writing, it provides you with detailed statistics on the most frequently miss-clicked keys, so that You will pay attention to them in the future.
    </p>
    <p>
      Starting from May, CodeRush allows You to create a multiplayer server, so that You can compete with invited friends.
